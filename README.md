# Making Code DRY Practice

Clone the practice from the [starter].

## Directions

You will find 4 functions in the file **DRY-code-practice.js**. Your job is to
look at the 4 functions and identify where you may be able to refactor by
creating a single helper function to DRY all the code in the 4 functions up.

When you are sure that you have successfully refactored the code, run
`node DRY-code-practice.js` to see if the functions still return the correct
information.
